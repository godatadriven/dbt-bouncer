# Frequently Asked Questions

## Can other tools perform the same checks as `dbt-bouncer`?

There are several other tools that perform similar tasks as `dbt-bouncer`.

- [dbt-checkpoint](): A collection of `pre-commit` hooks for dbt projects. Tests are written in python. Configuration is performed via `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. Provided the dbt artifacts have already been generated, `dbt-checkpoint` does not need access to the underlying database. The hooks execute when a new commit is made, as such `dbt-checkpoint` is designed to be run only as part of `pre-commit`.
- [dbt-project-evaluator](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-project-evaluator): This is a dbt package from dbt Labs. Tests are written in `.sql` files using a combination of Jinja and SQL. Configuration is performed via `dbt_project.yml` and seed files (i.e. csv files). Requires a connection to underlying database. Designed to be run both in a CI pipeline and also during active development.
- [dbt-score](https://github.com/PicnicSupermarket/dbt-score): This is a python package installable via `pip`. A collection of tests that apply only to dbt models. Tests can be executed from the command line. Tests are written in python. Configuration is performed via a `pyproject.toml` file. Provided the dbt artifacts have already been generated, `dbt-score` does not need access to the underlying database. Designed to be run during development.

While the above tools inhabit the same space as `dbt-bouncer` they do not provide what we consider to be the optimum experience that `dbt-bouncer` provides:

- Designed to run both locally and in a CI pipeline.
- Configurable via a file format, `YML`, that dbt developers are already familiar with.
- Does not require database access.
- Can run tests against any of dbt's artifacts.
- Allows tests to be written in python.

As such we consider `dbt-bouncer` to be the best tool to enforce conventions in a dbt project.

!!! tip

    `dbt-bouncer` can perform all the tests currently included in `dbt-checkpoint`, `dbt-project-evaluator` and `dbt-score`. If you see an existing test that is not possible with `dbt-bouncer`, open an [issue](https://github.com/godatadriven/dbt-bouncer/issues) and we'll add it!

## Does `dbt-bouncer` work with dbt Cloud?

Yes! As `dbt-bouncer` runs on the artifacts generated by dbt, it can be used with dbt Cloud as long as the artifacts generated by the CI job in dbt Cloud are available.

For GitHub this can be achieved using the [pgoslatara/dbt-cloud-download-artifacts-action](https://github.com/pgoslatara/dbt-cloud-download-artifacts-action) action:
```yaml
name: CI pipeline

on:
  pull_request:
      branches:
          - main

jobs:
    download-artifacts:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        permissions:
            pull-requests: write
        steps:
          - name: Checkout
            uses: actions/checkout@v4

          - name: Download dbt artifacts
            uses: pgoslatara/dbt-cloud-download-artifacts-action@v1
            with:
              commit-sha: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}
              dbt-cloud-api-token: ${{ secrets.DBT_CLOUD_API_TOKEN }}

          - name: Run dbt-bouncer
            uses: godatadriven/dbt-bouncer@vX.X
```

!!! warning

    dbt Cloud now supports a "[versionless](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/upgrade-dbt-version-in-cloud#versionless)" option, which allows dbt projects to be run with the latest version of dbt. One effect of choosing this option is that dbt artifacts may receive non-breaking changes ([source](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/blob/main/core/dbt/artifacts/README.md#making-changes-to-dbtartifacts)), these may or may not be compatible with `dbt-bouncer`. If you encounter a bug as a result of this, please open an [issue](https://github.com/godatadriven/dbt-bouncer/issues) and we'll investigate.

## How to set up `dbt-bouncer` in a monorepo?

A monorepo may consist of one directory with a dbt project and other directories with unrelated code. It may be desired for `dbt-bouncer` to be configured from the root directory. Sample directory tree:

```shell
.
├── dbt-bouncer.yml
├── README.md
├── dbt-project
│   ├── models
│   ├── dbt_project.yml
│   └── profiles.yml
└── package-a
    ├── src
    ├── tests
    └── package.json
```

To ease configuration you can use `exclude` or `include` at the global level (see [Config File](./config_file.md) for more details). For the above example `dbt-bouncer.yml` could be configured as:

```yaml
dbt_artifacts_dir: dbt-project/target
include: ^dbt-project

manifest_checks:
    - name: check_exposure_based_on_non_public_models
```

`dbt-bouncer` can now be run from the root directory.

## How to set up `dbt-bouncer` with `pre-commit`?

You can use a local hook to run automatically run `dbt-bouncer` before your commits get added to the git tree.

```yaml
- repo: local
  hooks:
    - id: dbt-bouncer
      name: dbt-bouncer
      entry: dbt-bouncer # --config-file <PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE>
      language: system
      pass_filenames: false
      always_run: true
```
