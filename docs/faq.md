# Frequently Asked Questions

## Can other tools perform the same checks as `dbt-bouncer`?

There are several other tools that perform similar tasks as `dbt-bouncer`.

- [dbt-checkpoint](): A collection of `pre-commit` hooks for dbt projects. Tests are written in python. Configuration is performed via `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. Provided the dbt artifacts have already been generated, `dbt-checkpoint` does not need access to the underlying database. The hooks execute when a new commit is made, as such `dbt-checkpoint` is designed to be run only as part of `pre-commit`.
- [dbt-project-evaluator](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-project-evaluator): This is a dbt package from dbt Labs. Tests are written in `.sql` files using a combination of Jinja and SQL. Configuration is performed via `dbt_project.yml` and seed files (i.e. csv files). Requires a connection to underlying database. Designed to be run both in a CI pipeline and also during active development.
- [dbt-score](https://github.com/PicnicSupermarket/dbt-score): This is a python package installable via `pip`. A collection of tests that apply only to dbt models. Tests can be executed from the command line. Tests are written in python. Configuration is performed via a `pyproject.toml` file. Provided the dbt artifacts have already been generated, `dbt-score` does not need access to the underlying database. Designed to be run during development.

While the above tools inhabit the same space as `dbt-bouncer` they do not provide what we consider to be the optimum experience that `dbt-bouncer` provides:

- Designed to run both locally and in a CI pipeline.
- Configurable via a file format, `YML`, that dbt developers are already familiar with.
- Does not require database access.
- Can run tests against any of dbt's artifacts.
- Allows tests to be written in python.

As such we consider `dbt-bouncer` to be the best tool to enforce conventions in a dbt project.

!!! tip

    `dbt-bouncer` can perform all the tests currently included in `dbt-checkpoint`, `dbt-project-evaluator` and `dbt-score`. If you see an existing test that is not possible with `dbt-bouncer`, open an [issue](https://github.com/godatadriven/dbt-bouncer/issues) and we'll add it!

## Does `dbt-bouncer` work with dbt Cloud?

Yes! As `dbt-bouncer` runs on the artifacts generated by dbt, it can be used with dbt Cloud as long as the artifacts generated by the CI job in dbt Cloud are available.

For GitHub this can be achieved using the [pgoslatara/dbt-cloud-download-artifacts-action](https://github.com/pgoslatara/dbt-cloud-download-artifacts-action) action:
```yaml
name: CI pipeline

on:
  pull_request:
      branches:
          - main

jobs:
    download-artifacts:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        permissions:
            pull-requests: write
        steps:
          - name: Checkout
            uses: actions/checkout@v4

          - name: Download dbt artifacts
            uses: pgoslatara/dbt-cloud-download-artifacts-action@v1
            with:
              commit-sha: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}
              dbt-cloud-api-token: ${{ secrets.DBT_CLOUD_API_TOKEN }}

          - name: Run dbt-bouncer
            uses: godatadriven/dbt-bouncer@vX.X
```

!!! warning

    dbt Cloud now supports a "[versionless](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/upgrade-dbt-version-in-cloud#versionless)" option, which allows dbt projects to be run with the latest version of dbt. One effect of choosing this option is that dbt artifacts may receive non-breaking changes ([source](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/blob/main/core/dbt/artifacts/README.md#making-changes-to-dbtartifacts)), these may or may not be compatible with `dbt-bouncer`. If you encounter a bug as a result of this, please open an [issue](https://github.com/godatadriven/dbt-bouncer/issues) and we'll investigate.

## How to configure `dbt-bouncer` for use in a CI pipeline?

`dbt-bouncer` is designed to be use primarily in a CI pipeline such as GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps. To do this we create a config file such as:

```yaml
catalog_checks:
  - name: check_column_description_populated
    include: ^models/marts

manifest_checks:
  - name: check_model_directories
    include: ^models
    permitted_sub_directories:
      - intermediate
      - marts
      - staging
      - utilities

run_results_checks:
  - name: check_run_results_max_execution_time
    max_execution_time_seconds: 10
```

The goal of a CI pipeline is to test the changes in a pull request but also to provide feedback to the developer as quickly as possible without incurring unnecessary costs (time, financial, compute, etc.). To achieve this we can combine several features of dbt and `dbt-bouncer`:

  1. By running `dbt parse`, dbt can generate a `manifest.json` without a database connection. We can then run our manifest checks via:

      ```shell
      dbt-bouncer --only manifest_checks
      ```

  1. dbt requires models to be materialised before it can generate a `catalog.json` file. By running `dbt run --empty` we can materialise every model without processing any data. Once these materialisations are performed we can run our catalog checks via:

      ```shell
      dbt-bouncer --only catalog_checks
      ```

  1. Typically a CI pipeline will run a `dbt build` command with flags such as `--state` and/or `--defer`. After this command has completed we can run our run results checks via:

      ```shell
      dbt-bouncer --only run_results_checks
      ```

By using this approach, and combining with your own unique constraints and desires, `dbt-bouncer` can be used efficiently as part of your CI pipeline.

## How to set up `dbt-bouncer` in a monorepo?

A monorepo may consist of one directory with a dbt project and other directories with unrelated code. It may be desired for `dbt-bouncer` to be configured from the root directory. Sample directory tree:

```shell
.
├── dbt-bouncer.yml
├── README.md
├── dbt-project
│   ├── models
│   ├── dbt_project.yml
│   └── profiles.yml
└── package-a
    ├── src
    ├── tests
    └── package.json
```

To ease configuration you can use `exclude` or `include` at the global level (see [Config File](./config_file.md) for more details). For the above example `dbt-bouncer.yml` could be configured as:

```yaml
dbt_artifacts_dir: dbt-project/target
include: ^dbt-project

manifest_checks:
    - name: check_exposure_based_on_non_public_models
```

`dbt-bouncer` can now be run from the root directory.

## How to set up `dbt-bouncer` in a dbt Mesh?

A [dbt Mesh](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-1-intro#what-is-dbt-mesh) is a collection of dbt projects in an organisation, some of which can read models from other dbt projects. Natively supported by dbt Cloud, a dbt Mesh can also be set up with dbt Core using a plugin such as [dbt-loom](https://github.com/nicholasyager/dbt-loom).

One challenge in a dbt Mesh is the large number of developers working across multiple dbt projects leading to differing conventions being implemented. There are multiple approaches to using `dbt-bouncer` in a dbt Mesh, two are outlined below.

### Approach 1: Individual `dbt-bouncer.yml` configuration file

Each dbt project can have its own `dbt-bouncer.yml` configuration file. This allows each project to adopt and implement its own conventions in addition to any conventions to be shared across all dbt projects. Should a breaking change be required to the config file then each dbt project can be updated independently at a time that makes sense.

This is the recommended approach due to its simplicity and ability to update each dbt project independently.

### Approach 2: Centralised `dbt-bouncer.yml` configuration file shared via git submodule

!!! warning

    With this approach, a change to the centralised `dbt-bouncer.yml` file may result in CI pipelines in dbt projects failing despite no changes being made to these projects. As such we recommend implementing this approach only after extensive discussion with all dbt project developers so that all dbt projects can be brought into line before `dbt-bouncer` is enforced in the CI pipeline.

    Should it be necessary for a breaking change to be made to the centralised `dbt-bouncer.yml` configuration file, we recommend setting the `severity` of the relevant check to `warn` so that CI pipelines in dbt projects will not fail and maintainers have sufficient time to make the necessary changes.

[Git submodules](https://github.blog/open-source/git/working-with-submodules/) allow the contents from one repository to be accessible from a different repository. Such a setup for `dbt-bouncer` can be achieved as follows (this example uses GitHub, similar setups can be achieved with other providers):

1. Set up a dedicated repository to store a centralised `dbt-bouncer.yml` configuration file that will be used by all dbt projects. Let's call this repository `dbt-bouncer-config`.

1. The contents of the `dbt-bouncer.yml` file in `dbt-bouncer-config` should contain the following configuration for `dbt_artifacts_dir`:

    ```yaml
    dbt_artifacts_dir: ../target

    manifest_checks:
      - name: check_model_directories
        include: ^models
        permitted_sub_directories:
          - intermediate
          - marts
          - staging
          - utilities
      ...
    ```

1. In every repository add a git submodule via:

    ```shell
    git submodule add git@github.com:<YOUR_ORG>/dbt-bouncer-config.git
    ```

1. Run `dbt-bouncer`:

    ```shell
    dbt-bouncer --config-file dbt-bouncer-config/dbt-bouncer.yml
    ```

Your directory tree should look like this:

```shell
.
├── dbt-bouncer-config
│   └── dbt-bouncer.yml
├── dbt_project.yml
├── macros
│   └── ...
├── models
│   └── ...
├── profiles.yml
├── README.md
└── target
    ├── catalog.json
    ├── manifest.json
    └── run_results.json
```

Note: if you update your central `dbt-bouncer.yml` file, you will need to run `git submodule update --remote` in every repository to update the submodule.

## How to set up `dbt-bouncer` with `pre-commit`?

You can use a local hook to run automatically run `dbt-bouncer` before your commits get added to the git tree.

```yaml
- repo: local
  hooks:
    - id: dbt-bouncer
      name: dbt-bouncer
      entry: dbt-bouncer # --config-file <PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE>
      language: system
      pass_filenames: false
      always_run: true
```
