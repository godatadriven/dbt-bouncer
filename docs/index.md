## Welcome to dbt-bouncer

`dbt-bouncer` is an open-source tool that allows you to configure and enforce conventions for your dbt project. The conventions are run against dbt's artifact files (think `./target/manifest.json`) resulting in speedy tests. Conventions can be specified in a `.yml` file, allowing maximum customisation to the conventions you wish to follow (or create ðŸ˜€).

Check out our [`Getting Started`](./getting_started.md) guide.

## Terminology

- __Check__: A check is a rule run against a dbt artifact.
- __Config file__: A `.yml` file that specifies which checks to run along with any parameters.
- __dbt artifacts directory__: The directory that contains the dbt artifacts (`manifest.json`, etc.), generally this is `./target`.

## Aims

`dbt-bouncer` aims to:

- Provide a 100% configurable way to enforce conventions in a dbt project.
- Be as fast as possible, running checks against dbt artifacts.
- Be as easy as possible to use, with a simple config file written in `YML`.
- Be as flexible as possible, allowing checks to be written in python.
- Provide immediate feedback when run as part of a CI pipeline.
